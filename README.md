Video Recorder
=============

<p>A simple video and sound recording app.</p>

<p>Built upon [SoundRecorder](https://github.com/dkim0419/SoundRecorder) by Daniel Kim</p>

<p>This was a class project for our Software Engineering university course. We had to take an existing
open source application and add new features to it. We added video recording and the ability to
organize recordings into folders. I worked on adding both of these features with my team members.</p>
